## ‚ùì About

Magma is the next generation of hybrid minecraft server softwares.

Magma is based on **Forge and Paper**, meaning it can run both **Craftbukkit/Spigot/Paper plugins and Forge mods**.

We hope to eliminate all issues with craftbukkit forge servers. In the end, we envision a seamless, low lag Magma experience with support for newer 1.12+ versions of Minecraft.

## üåê BungeeCord/Velocity

Magma 1.18 is **not** compatible with [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/downloads) or any [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord) fork.

This is **caused by Forge** and not a fault of Magma. We cannot fix this ourselves without modifying the client.

You might be able to use the Waterfall fork called [Lightfall](https://github.com/ArclightPowered/lightfall), but it requires a clientside-mod in order to work.

## üß™ Magma for 1.12+/1.16+

Magma for Minecraft 1.12 and above can be found in their own repositories.

- Click [here](https://github.com/magmafoundation/Magma) to visit the 1.12 repository.
