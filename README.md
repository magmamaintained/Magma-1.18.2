## ‚ùì About

Magma is the next generation of hybrid minecraft server softwares.

Magma is based on **Forge and Paper**, meaning it can run both **Craftbukkit/Spigot/Paper plugins and Forge mods**.

We hope to eliminate all issues with craftbukkit forge servers. In the end, we envision a seamless, low lag Magma experience with support for newer 1.12+ versions of Minecraft.

## üåê BungeeCord/Velocity

Magma 1.18 is **not** compatible with **vanilla** BungeeCord or any of its forks. This is **caused by Forge** and not a fault of Magma. We cannot fix this ourselves without modifying the client.
You might be able to use the Waterfall fork called [Lightfall](https://github.com/ArclightPowered/lightfall), but it also requires a clientside-mod in order to work and is not officially supported.

You can use **our [Velocity fork](https://git.magmafoundation.org/magmafoundation/Velocity)** with our [clientside mod](https://git.magmafoundation.org/magmafoundation/Forge-Client-Reset-Packet/-/tree/1.18). Every player needs to install this mod in order to join the server!

Magma 1.18 is **not** compatible with **vanilla** [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/downloads/). This is **caused by Forge** and not a fault of Magma. We cannot fix this ourselves without modifying the client and the proxy.

## üß™ Magma for 1.12+/1.16+
